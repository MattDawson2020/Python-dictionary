## 🐍 Python dictionary

- First example project from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Simple dictionary that takes a Json file with dictionary definitions stored as key value pairs, parses and prints the data based on a CLI search
- Covers standard libraries, Python dictionaries as well as everything from [the basics](https://github.com/MattDawson2020/Python-basics) section of the course


## 📓 Comments

- Extremely simple by the standards I've worked with and could have figured out with only documentation/ googling
- However was beneficial to watch how an experienced Python developer handles Json/ file data as this is a common use of Python
